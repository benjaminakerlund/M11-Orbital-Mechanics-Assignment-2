\section{Visibility of a sub satellite point} 

 
\textbf{Let’s consider the point P on Earth located at P (0° latitude, 0°, longitude). }
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{Describe (in plain language) the conditions for the point P to be visible from the CubeSat.}
    \item[-] \textbf{Describe an algorithm that allows to determine if the point P is visible from the CubeSat.}
    \item[-] \textbf{Code this algorithm and show, on a ground map, the points of the orbit which are visible from this point P.}
    \item[-] \textbf{What is the duration of the visibility for a satellite passing at the zenith of P?}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{Express the vector (CubeSat, P) in satellite local orbital frame.}
    \item[-] \textbf{Describe an algorithm to compute the direction of the point P in local orbital reference frame.}
    \item[-] Code this algorithm and show, on a 3D plot, the vector wrt time over one orbit.
