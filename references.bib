	abstract = {This chapter explores the means of describing orbits in three-dimensional space, starting with the use of right ascension and declination to define the location of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. We proceed to the concept of a six-component state vector in three dimensions and introduce the inertial geocentric equatorial frame of reference. The six classical orbital elements are defined. The procedure for obtaining the orbital elements from the state vector is explained. An introduction to general Cartesian coordinate transformations is followed by its application to the transformation between geocentric equatorial and perifocal frames. We then show how to obtain the state vector from the orbital elements. The chapter concludes with a consideration of the primary effects of the earthâ€™s oblateness on orbital elements and a discussion of ground tracks.},
