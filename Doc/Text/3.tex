\section{Attitude Determination and Control System (AOCS)}

\textbf{The payload onboard your satellite has a pointing requirement of 0,5°. You have to design a AOCS for the cubesat, with a budget of about 100 kEuros. The sensors and actuators that you can use are to be found on \url{https://www.cubesatshop.com/}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{Make a schematics diagram (such as the one found on slide 61 of “9-10.pdf”) of the AOCS control system with the (real) elements found here. }

    \item[-] \textbf{Explain why you chose each element and how many of each are needed. }

    Since we are conducting a CubeSat mission which is being released from the ISS we can make a few assumptions about the requirements that will drive the design of the AOCS system.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{CubeSat size:} Since the ISS CubeSat deployers (J-SSOD and NRCSD) seem to accomodate up to 6U \cite{deployers_wiki} cubesats and most recent CubeSats deployed from the ISS have been up to 3U we will assume 3U as a reasonable size and design driver for the mission.
        This size limitation of 30cm x 30cm x 30cm for the CubeSat wall designs will dictate the size and amount of systems the satellite can accomodate

        \item Assuming the CubeSat is used for Earth-related observations or measurements, we will leave the Nadir face empty of AOCS systems to leave space for the payload.
        Thus, an earth sensor is out of question for attitude sensing.
