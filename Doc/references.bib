	abstract = {This chapter explores the means of describing orbits in three-dimensional space, starting with the use of right ascension and declination to define the location of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. We proceed to the concept of a six-component state vector in three dimensions and introduce the inertial geocentric equatorial frame of reference. The six classical orbital elements are defined. The procedure for obtaining the orbital elements from the state vector is explained. An introduction to general Cartesian coordinate transformations is followed by its application to the transformation between geocentric equatorial and perifocal frames. We then show how to obtain the state vector from the orbital elements. The chapter concludes with a consideration of the primary effects of the earth’s oblateness on orbital elements and a discussion of ground tracks.},

	abstract = {The Nanoracks {CubeSat} Deployer ({NRCSD}) is a device to deploy {CubeSats} into orbit from the International Space Station ({ISS}).
In 2014, two {CubeSat} deployers were on board the International Space Station ({ISS}): the Japanese Experiment Module ({JEM}) Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-{SSOD}) and the Nanoracks {CubeSat} Deployer ({NRCSD}). The J-{SSOD} is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the International Space Station ({ISS}). The {NRCSD} is the first commercially operated small satellite deployer from the {ISS}, maximizing full capabilities of each airlock cycle of deployments.
{CubeSats} belong to a class of research spacecraft called nanosatellites. The basic cube-shaped satellites measure 10 cm (3.9 in) on each side, weigh less than 1.4 kg (3.1 lb), and have a volume of about 1 L (0.22 imp gal; 0.26 {US} gal), although there are {CubeSats} which are built and deployed with sizes of multiples of 10 cm in length.
As of 2014, one method of getting {CubeSats} to orbit is to transport them aboard a larger spacecraft as part of a cargo load to a larger space station. When this is done, deploying the {CubeSats} into orbit as a separate artificial satellite requires a special apparatus, such as the Nanoracks {CubeSat} Deployer. The {NRCSD} is put into position to be grabbed by one of the {ISS}'s robotic arms, which then places the {CubeSat} deployer into the correct position externally mounted to the {ISS} to be able to release the miniature satellites into proper orbit.},
